# KeyJumper

This project demonstrates arbitrary kernel code execution on a Windows 11 system with kCET enabled, to create a keylogging tool by mapping kernel memory to userland.

You can find my blogpost about it [here](https://blog.slowerzs.net/posts/keyjumper/) for more information.


## Compilation

This project uses the Meson build system, and is written in `C23`. MSVC does not yet support `C23` (I think?), so I suggest using `clang-cl` as a compiler.

Setup the `CC` and `LD` environment variables (`clang-cl` and `lld-link` if using the LLVM tooclhain), then:
```
meson setup builddir
meson compile -C builddir
```

## Windows version

This project uses hardcoded offsets, that were taken on a Windows 11 22H2, build version `22261.4890`. To target another version, updating the offsets is required.
All the offsets of the gadgets used are located within `include/jop/offsets.h`.

While not all gadgets have exact equivalents on other version, the central elements do, and others have remplacements (`pop rax ; ... ; jmp XXX`, `call XXX ; ... ; jmp XXX`).
